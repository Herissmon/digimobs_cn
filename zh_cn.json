Because its surface has not hardened yet, its defensive power is nonexistent and it is equally unsuited for combat. From the portion that looks like a pacifier held in its mouth, it generates tiny bubbles, and proliferates them infinitely. As for that proliferation, at one point, it started being used for computer virus development, but because its life force was too weak, that was fortunately never implemented. Although its life is fleeting, it is a lovable Digimon Baby that lives earnestly.",

When it hatches from its Digiegg, it seeks an environment suitable for its growth, and drifts lightly through the air, like a dandelion seed. If it finds a place where there will be no intruders and where the environment is good, it will settle to the ground and begin preparations for evolution. Its offensive ability is practically nil, so it will spit out adhesive bubbles to hinder the opponent's movement, then seize the opportunity to escape.",

Since it seems to be living with nothing but emotions, its behavior changes very frequently. Since it is extremely full of curiosity, it greatly wishes to communicate with the outside world, but as yet, no means to do so has been found. However, it is a Digimon Baby that is loved by everyone, due to its big, bright red eyes which are charming enough to shake the opponent's feelings.",

The appearance of it moving around restlessly seems very cute, but because it is carrying nothing but a simple program that moves in reaction to bright lights, if its surroundings go dark it becomes completely unable to move. The reason why is not understood, but when it is in a good mood, it discharges electricity from the tip of its tail.",

It is a unique Digimon whose computer kernel (Digicore), said to be at the center of a Digimon's body, is bare, so it seems it protects its Digicore with Smoke. Because its Digicore is bare, Mokumon is a Digimon of an unusual way of life which covers its body in Smoke from when it was burned. It scatters the Smoke issuing from its body all around, then seizes the opportunity to flee.",

It nimbly maneuvers its pliable body, and moves as if crawling across the ground. Because the substance composing its body is a potent toxin, and it spews intensely venomous bubbles from its mouth, even large Digimon will not approach it.",

The aggression generated by the malice of people who abuse the Computer Network, and the conflicts which are unfolding on the Network, manifested and a single Digiegg was created. Humanity's destruction instinct is condensed within that Digiegg, and as such the mysterious Digimon that was born from it is a very dangerous being.
